# Investigate-Movie-Dataset
In this project, I analyzez a dataset and communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do the analysis

This Python script is written for Project and is used to explore movie data. But what determines if a movie is considered as good or bad? There could be several factors influencig the quality of a movie, as for example the budget, genre, etc. This little project helped the author to improve his data analytics skills and explore some of the success criteria for movies.

First some Data Wrangling was applied, before the data was cleaned in order to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

## How to run the script
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE). This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. The code was written in Jupyter Notebook.

## Datasets
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

Variables:

id,
imdb_id,
popularity,
budget,
revenue,
original_title,
cast,
homepage,
director,
tagline,
keywords,
overview,
runtime,
genres,
production_companies,
release_date,
vote_count,
vote_average,
release_year,
budget_adj,
revenue_adj.
